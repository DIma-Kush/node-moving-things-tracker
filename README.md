# node-tracker-by-detections

Tracker by detections wrote in javascript for node.js / browsers

### Introduction

node-tracker-by-detections is a javascript implementation of the _"tracker by detections"_ for multiple object tracking (MOT).

It takes in input a txt file _(TODO change to json)_ generated by [node-yolo](https://github.com/moovel/node-yolo) and outputs a `tracker.json` file that assigns unique IDs to the YOLO detections bbox.


### Installation and usage

> Requires node.js , available as a npm module: http://npmjs.com/node-tracker-by-detections

```bash
# Install globaly to use as command line tool
npm install -g node-tracker-by-detections 

# Install localy your node.js / javascript project
npm install --save node-tracker-by-detections 
```

**Command line usage**

> NOTE : for now customized for the use case of [lab-beat-the-traffic](https://github.com/moovel/lab-beat-the-traffic)

```bash
node-tracker-by-detections PATH_TO_YOLO_DETECTIONS.txt
# This will output a tracker.json file in the same folder containing the tracker data
```

**As an external module**

> See usage in [lab-traffic-cam](https://github.com/moovel/lab-traffic-cam/blob/master/server/counter/Counter.js#L57)

```javascript
const Tracker = require('node-tracker-by-detections').Tracker;

Tracker.updateTrackedItemsWithNewFrame(detectionScaledOfThisFrame, currentFrame);

const trackerDataForThisFrame = Tracker.getJSONOfTrackedItems();
```

### Limitations

No params tweaking is possible via command-line for now, it is currently optimized for car tracking, and many improvements are [still to be implemented](https://github.com/tdurand/node-tracker-by-detections/issues/2).
